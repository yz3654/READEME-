Description: 
What we implemented from part1: We developed a login page and a sign up page for each user in the first place when they enter
the website. After they login to the website, they will be guided to a user homepage, here we store their information, their 
favorite sneakers, the sneakers that they searched, the users that they followed. We develped a page that contains all the 
information about the sneakers that have been sold by at least one vendor, then we compared the price and find the vendor 
that sold sneakers at lowest price.

User page:
In this page we store information about the user, which include user name, user's list of favorite sneakers, user's followers 
and who user has followed, also the sneakers that user has searched, this will help us to develop suggestions in the future use
of the website. We also include the information of posts if the user has created a post.

Shoe Listing page:
In this page, user can find the cheapest price of each sold sneaker. For example, ('OFF-WHITE x AIR FORCE 1 LOW 07 MCA', 
'UNIVERSITY BLUE/WHITE-UNIVERSITY', 10.0, 'AIR', 'Nike', 'STOCKX', 610.5) represents a sneaker named 'OFF-WHITE x AIR FORCE 1 
LOW 07 MCA'with color 'UNIVERSITY BLUE/WHITE-UNIVERSITY' at size 10 has been sold bt vendor 'STOCKX' at price 610.5, also, the 
collection name of this sneaker is 'AIR' and brand is 'Nike'. We are trying to list out the information that can help user to 
decide which sneaker to purchase and which vendor would be the best choice.
